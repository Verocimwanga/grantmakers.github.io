						<h5>Where does the data come from?</h5>
						<p>IRS Form 990-PF published in machine-readable format. The raw data files are released by the IRS on a rolling basis and hosted by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/irs-990/">Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
						<h5>Can profiles be edited or removed?</h5>
						<p>We have no control over the information provided in the public dataset by the IRS. Any inquiries as to removing information should be made <a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/e-file-for-charities-and-non-profits">directly with the IRS</a>.</p>
						<h5>Why can't I find [Foundation X]?</h5>
						<p>Grantmakers.io is a mirror image of the IRS electronic dataset. If you can't find a foundation, it's likely that:</p>
						<ul class="browser-default">
							<li>They don't file Form 990-PF (the form that private foundations file)</li>
							<li>They don't file their tax returns electronically</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We've seen a few isolated instances where the foundation files their returns electroncially, but the IRS still does not include them in the electronic dataset. The reasons for this is unknown. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
						<h5>Why is Grantmakers.io free?</h5>
						<p>The better question is why should it cost anything? The source data is published for free by the IRS. The site is hosted for free by Github Pages. The search is provided for free by Algolia. There is zero cost in hosting and maintaining this site.</p>
						<h5>Do you make any changes to the data?</h5>
						<p>All data found on Grantmakers.io is presented exactly as found in the tax filings, with the following exceptions:</p>
						<ul class="browser-default">
							<li>City names are converted from UPPERCASE to Titlecase as needed.</li>
							<li>An 'N/A' label is added to missing or omitted fields in foreign address listings (e.g. if the state field is omitted, Grantmakers.io shows the 'N/A' label).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In addition, to keep the site free for everyone, the number of searchable grants is limited to 5 million. Currently, there are {{ site.number_of_grants | divided_by: 1000000 }}.{{ site.number_of_grants | modulo: 1000000 | divided_by: 100000 | append: "m" }} grants in the dataset. As a result:</p>
						<ul class="browser-default">
							<li>Grant listings for Bank of America Charitable Foundation are limited to tax years 2016 and later.</li>
							<li>Grant listings for 2009 and 2010 tax years are excluded from the searchable database.</li>
							<li>Older profiles - funders whose latest published tax year is 2009 or 2010 - show only the 50 largest grants.</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Who are the people behind this?</h5>
						<p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.chadkruse.com">Chad Kruse</a>, the primary author behind Grantmakers.io. While most of the public code commits have my name on them, I couldn't have built this site without the counsel of good friends, former colleagues, and all of the amazing developers behind the open source projects leveraged to make this site.</p>
						<h5>How do I get involved?</h5>
						<p><a href="https://github.com/grantmakers/grantmakers.github.io">Fork the code</a> and tell the world what you made and why you made it. We built this site and open sourced all the code to inspire others to explore new ways to disseminate and share philanthropic data.</p>
